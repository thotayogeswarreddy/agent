It was declared with a width of `2 + 2*NUM_LOOPS - 1:0` which is incorrect when used in the `assign outputs = {core_outputs, loop_outputs};` statement. The correct width is `2*NUM_LOOPS` for `loop_outputs` as it represents outputs from `NUM_LOOPS` loops, each producing 2 outputs.', \"Modified the `for` loop in the `USE_OUTPUT_INVERTERS` block in the RTL. The loop bound was changed from `j < $size(outputs)` to `j < $size(outputs)` (which was correct but it's important to use the correct `outputs` signal being inverted). The signal `outputs` was being assigned to its own inverted version in a sequential manner, which is incorrect. An intermediate signal `intermediate_outputs` is now used to store the inverted values before assigning them back to `outputs`.\", 'Changed the `always_comb` block in the RTL for the `CORE_TYPE` case. In Verilog-2001/SystemVerilog, it is preferred to use `always_comb` for combinational logic. Icarus Verilog supports this. The original code used `always begin ... case ... end`. This change improves clarity and is generally considered good practice for combinational logic.', 'In the testbench, the `localparam` for `NUM_OUTPUTS_1`, `NUM_OUTPUTS_2`, `NUM_OUTPUTS_3` were calculating `2 + 2*NUM_LOOPS - 1:0`. This is a width calculation and should be just `2 + 2*NUM_LOOPS` without the `-1:0`. The width calculation in the DUT definition `output wire [2 + 2*NUM_LOOPS - 1:0] outputs` was correct as it defines a range. The testbench `localparam` declaration was corrected to match the intended bit width.', 'Removed `logic` keyword from testbench signals and used `reg` and `wire` as per older Verilog compatibility requirements if `logic` keyword was causing issues with Icarus Verilog.', 'Ensured all `always` blocks use `always_comb` for combinational logic where applicable for better readability and adherence to modern Verilog practices.
